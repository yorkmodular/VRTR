## dual-attenuverter

A simple (emphasis on _simple) dual attenuverter for your Eurorack synth. If you're after hyper-precision, zero offsetting and stuff like that then you're in the wrong place - however, if you want a way to turn those signals upside down and back again then you're in the right place.

Eagle-eyed viewers will notice that there are two boards - the 'main' board contains the controls and is connected to a daughterboard via a right-angle header. Construction is simple, requiring a handful of resistors, capacitors and whatnot. 

What's even better is that it'll fit behind a 2HP panel so it needn't necessarily take up much space either.

An ideal beginner's project, in fact.
